{"songId":1,"songTitle":"Dancing With Tears In My Eyes","lyric":"Dancing with tears in my eyes\nWeeping for the memory of a life gone by\nDancing with tears in my eyes\nLiving out a memory of a love that died\n\nIt's five and I'm driving home again\nIt's hard to believe that it's my last time\nThe man on the wireless cries again:\n\"It's over, it's over\"\n\nDancing with tears in my eyes\nWeeping for the memory of a life gone by\nDancing with tears in my eyes\nLiving out a memory of a love that died\n\nIt's late and I'm with my love alone\nWe drink to forget the coming storm\nWe love to the sound of our favourite song\nOver and over\n\nDancing with tears in my eyes\nLiving out a memory of a love that died\n\nIt's time and we're in each others arms\nIt's time but I don't think we really care\n\nDancing with tears in my eyes\nWeeping for the memory of a life gone by\nDancing with tears in my eyes\nWeeping for the memory of a life gone by\n\nDancing with tears in my eyes..."}
